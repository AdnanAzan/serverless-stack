description: "Using the monorepo structure for your SST app"
---

While you can structure your SST app in many different ways, many teams we talked to adopts the monorepo structure. So we decided to put together a [starter repo](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack/tree/master/examples/typescript-monorepo) to make it easier for teams to get started.

To get started:
```bash
yarn create serverless-stack --use-yarn --example typescript
```
