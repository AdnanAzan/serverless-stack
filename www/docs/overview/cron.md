If you want to schedule functions to run at specified times, use the [`Cron`](../constructs/Cron.md) construct. Here are some examples.

:::info Example

This tutorial steps through creating a simple serverless Cron job.

## Rate expressions

You can specify a rate at which a function runs, ie. every 5 minutes.

```js
import { Cron } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

new Cron(this, "Cron", {
  schedule: "rate(5 minutes)",
  job: "src/lambda.main",
});
```

:::note
If the value is equal to 1, then the unit must be singular. If the value is greater than 1, the unit must be plural.
:::

Here are some sample rate expressions.
- `rate(1 minute)`
- `rate(5 minutes)`
- `rate(1 hour)`
- `rate(12 hours)`
- `rate(1 day)`
- `rate(7 days)`

The fastest rate a function can be run is every 1 minute.

## Cron expressions

You can specify a cron expression to have a function run at specific times, ie. every day at 12:00pm.

```js
import { Cron } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

new Cron(this, "Cron", {
  schedule: "cron(0 12 * * ? *)",
  job: "src/lambda.main",
});
```

:::note
All cron expressions use UTC+0 time zone.
